# DesyncOscillators
Here I am trying to model the behaviour of simple amplitude-phase oscillators.
The main model for a single oscillator is modified Poincare oscillator.
I am trying to simulate the effects of amplitude relaxation rate, twist (parameter linking amplitude and period), 
coupling between oscillators (modeled as mean-field coupling),
